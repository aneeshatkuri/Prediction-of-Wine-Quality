# Prediction-of-Wine-Quality
The principal purpose of this ML project is to develop a machine learning model to foretell the quality of wines by investigating their different chemical properties. The dataset of wine quality comprises 4898 observations with 1 dependent variable and 11 independent variables.

For this project, I used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:

    Fixed acidity
    Volatile acidity
    Citric acid
    Residual sugar
    Chlorides
    Free sulfur dioxide
    Total sulfur dioxide
    Density
    pH
    Sulfates
    Alcohol

Objectives

The objectives of this project are as follows:

    To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy
    To determine which features are the most indicative of a good quality wine

Steps included in this project:

    Importing Lib
    Loading Data
    Understanding Data
    Missing Values
    Exploring Variables(Data Anylasis)
    Feature Selection
    Proportion of Good vs Bad Wines
    Preparing Data for Modelling
    Applying different models
    Choosing right model
    Hurray you just completed the task !
    
CHEERS!
